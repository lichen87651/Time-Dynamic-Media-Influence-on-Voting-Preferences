# Time-Dynamic-Media-Influence-on-Voting-Preferences

The code and data preprocessing scripts for a study examining how short-term media content exposure relates to individual-level voting preferences. By linking news articles to individual survey responses from the American National Election Studies (ANES), the project explores whether real-time issue framing and sentiment toward candidates can help predict vote choice.
